I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science with minors in molecular medicine, computer science, and statistics at West Virginia University. I'm involved in multiple health-related research projects, including investigating the Affordable Care Act's impact on lung cancer, and genetically monitoring over 200 viruses
and their variants in West Virginia patient samples from all around the state.
